# Safe Chat

Safe Chat is a Minecraft plugin that protects players' messages and ensures that they are not reported while the plugin is enabled.
The plugin works in a way that the game won't mark messages as unverified or unsafe.

## Features

- Ensures that messages are not reported.
- Overrides vanilla commands `msg`, `tell`, and `w` for safe direct chat.
- Reload configurations using the `reload-config` command (permission needed `bukkit.command.reload`).

## Configurations

The plugin provides options to configure the format of messages.
When the plugin is enabled for the first time, it generates the configuration file.
You can change the configuration file as per your requirements.

The format of messages can contain strings inside curly brackets that will be replaced with appropriate values.
